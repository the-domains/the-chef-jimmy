**Flambéed Pan Seared Steak With Thyme and Peppercorns**
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ba6ccd3b-7882-4e87-a16c-26a33baead22.jpg)

_Ingredients_:

1 top sirloin steak, (or steak of your preference) approx. 1½ pounds and 1½ inches thick

1 tbsp. coconut oil, unrefined

4 cloves of garlic, minced, chopped or left whole

4-5 sprigs of fresh thyme

2 tablespoons peppercorn

1/2 ounce of whiskey

1 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon pepper

_Instructions_: Steak should be at room temperature when you begin so make sure to take the steak out the fridge at least 30 minutes prior to prepping and cooking. Heat a medium to large size cast iron skillet over high heat. Season both sides of the steak evenly with salt and pepper. Combine the garlic, thyme and peppercorns and set aside. Once the pan is extremely hot add the coconut oil, and spices (garlic, thyme and peppercorns), immediately place the steak next to the spices in the pan. Now use a basting technique to cover the steak with the coconut oil while cooking by slightly tilting the pan, and spooning the oil and spices over the steak while it's cooking. Do this several times. After about 3-5 minutes, depending on thickness of the steak, turn the steak over with tongs, and repeat the basting process on the other side until cooked to your preference. Turn off the heat and carefully add the whiskey to your pan, then using a lighter and standing back, ignite the liquid in the pan and the steak will flambé and the flame will go out on its own. Let the steak sit for a few minutes before serving, then enjoy!

**Cauliflower Parmesan Mushroom "Risotto" with Truffle Oil**

_Ingredients_:

1 medium head of cauliflower 1 cup chicken or vegetable broth (low-sodium)

1 15 oz. can of cannellini beans (white kidney beans), drained and rinsed

1/2 cup onion, chopped

3/4 cup mushrooms, sliced

4 cloves of garlic, minced

2 tsp coconut oil

1/2 tsp pepper

1/4 tsp salt

2 tbsp. lemon juice

1/2 cup parmesan cheese or nutritional yeast

1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped

1 tbsp. truffle oil

_Instructions_: Cut the cauliflower into florets and add about a cup at a time into a food processor and pulse until the cauliflower is like finely chopped 'rice'. Put cauliflower in a mixing bowl and set aside. Combine beans and broth in the food processor or blender and puree until smooth. Set aside the mixture. Next, add the coconut oil to a large skillet and cook on medium heat, add onions and mushrooms, stirring often until mushrooms are brown and onions are soft. Add the minced garlic, salt and pepper, stir and continue to cook for another minute. Add lemon juice, stir and continue cooking until almost all the liquid is evaporated. Now add the bean puree to the skillet and bring to a simmer. Stir in the riced cauliflower, cover and cook until the cauliflower is tender, stirring occasionally, for about 7-9 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir in almost all of the parmesan cheese or nutritional yeast, (leave out a little to sprinkle on top of your finished 'risotto') Turn off the heat and add almost all the parsley, and stir, (again, leaving out a little to sprinkle on top of the finished 'risotto') Finish off the dish with a drizzle of truffle oil, and a sprinkle of parmesan/nutritional yeast and parsley.
